    "# Open science 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will cover the broad communities and tools at your disposal for collecting, managing, and analyzing your data in a sensible manner. These are all prerequisites for making your work reproducible - fortunately, they also let you do things much more efficiently and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The lifecycle of a project\n",
    "Any project moves in cycles and science is no different. In fact, understanding the cycle of science - and where it can go awry - is a crucial part of calling yourself a scientist. Here's a really high-level view of what happens in any scientific paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be interested in something\n",
    "* Read the literature\n",
    "* Plan an experiment\n",
    "* Conduct the experiment / collect the data\n",
    "* Store and catalogue the data\n",
    "* Analyze the data\n",
    "* Refine the analysis\n",
    "* Write up the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded in this straightforward list are a number of feedback loops, where you move back a few steps and repeat a step using the knowledge that you've gained thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, open science is about improving this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where this cycle can go wrong...\n",
    "It turns out there are a lot of ways that the steps above run really inefficiently right now. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be interested in something  <-- Most people learn about science through intermediate sources, because articles aren't usually available and scientists aren't trained in communication skills.\n",
    "* Read the literature  <-- Reading the literature is exceedingly difficult if you're not at a university that pays extremely large licensing fees to conglomerates of journals.\n",
    "* Planning and conducting an experiment  <-- details on exactly how an experiment is conducted can be incomplete at best, and frustratingly sparse at worst.\n",
    "* Storing and cataloging the data  <-- Most scientists are given zero formal training on the best ways for structuring and storing data, which leads to a *lot* of headaches down the road.\n",
    "* Analyze the data  <-- On that note, most scientists also aren't given any formal training in data analysis.\n",
    "* Refine the analysis  <-- While running an analysis is hard enough, it's even hard to incorporate this into a broader cycle that asks questions using data.\n",
    "* Write up the results  <-- remember that lack of communication skills? turns out it's just as important for making your colleagues understand your work too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open science tries to address many of the problems described above. It does this by ensuring that the fruits of our labor are as discoverable, understandable, and useful as possible. In this sense, it fulfills the *entire point* of science, which is to collectively work to further our knowledge of the world."

    "# Where does data reproducibility fit in?\n",
    "\n",
    "While each scientific domain has its own quirks for doing the best it can, one thread that binds us all together is the extent to which we rely on computers to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and share our data and results. Nowadays, doing your science openly, reproducibly, and efficiently means having a pretty sophisticated set of skills with the computer. Unfortunately, this reality has set in faster than universities have been able to adapt their training programs accordinly, which is why we're here today.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The basic unit of science is data\n",
    "\n",
    "And that data is always stored on a computer. As such, here are a few things you need to learn in order to make the most of the data you've got:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn an open-source language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have many tools for storing and analyzing our data, you should use the tools that leverage an open-source language such as **R, Python, or Julia**. The open-source community shares many of the same principles that science does, and in the last decade we have seen a rapid movement away from closed languages such as Matlab and SPSS towards their open-source counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, open source languages are generally **more powerful**, **more flexible**, and **more useful outside of science**. For these reasons alone you should start your scientific career working with an OS language. The fact that you get all of these tools for free (and can freely share them with others) is icing on the cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These materials will focus on Python**. While any open-source language is fine, I've found python to be the most flexible and promising in looking towards the future. We'll go over a few pieces of the python ecosystem now (though again, I don't care what language you use as long as it's open).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The scientific python ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy\n",
    "The reason that python is so useful is that it is a completely general computer language - it makes no commitments to particular use cases such as data analysis. This actually creates a drawback: it means we need to define what it means to \"analyze data\" from first principles within the language. For example, how do you take the dot product between two vectors of numbers when your language doesn't know what a vector is?"

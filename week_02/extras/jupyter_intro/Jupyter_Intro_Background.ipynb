    "Jupyter notebook, formerly known as IPython (or Interactive Python), is a flexible and powerful open source research tool that can help you keep a narrative of your coding process. The name Jupyter is an acronym of the three core languages it was designed for: **JU**lia, **PYT**hon, and **R**. Project Jupyter supports interactive data science and scientific computing across more than 40 programming languages.\n",

    "You can think of the notebook as a lab or field diary that keeps a detailed record of the steps you take as you develop scripts and programming workflows. Just as you would with a field notebook, it is important to develop good note-taking habits. This workshop is designed to impart a set of skills, tools, and best practices you can implement in your own research to enhance reprodubility, which will make modifications, collaboration, and publishing easier. \n",

For example, in the future you may use jupyter notebooks to include code within a manuscript that also can be used to re-create a figure. People have even published entire textbooks using only jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "2. **Notebook Document:** A representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects. These documents are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be version-controlled and shared with colleagues.\n",

    "Jupyter also has some **back-end** processes, including the:\n",

    "3. **Kernel:** A separate process responsible for running user code. For the purposes of this workshop, we will be working on Python kernels, although Jupyter is capable of interfacing with other programming languages as well. \n",
    "4. **Notebook Server:** ? Communicates with kernel and routes the Python programming language to the web browser. \n",

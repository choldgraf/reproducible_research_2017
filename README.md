# An introduction to reproducible research

These materials are a collection of jupyter notebooks that were used
to teach three sessions on reproducible research in science. They focus
on data workflows, visualizations, and analysis pipelines. They've got
a general focus on python though the main concepts apply to any computing
language.

Within each week, click on `index.ipynb` to see a rendered version of that
week's landing page. In there are links to other notebooks in the series.

## Overview of weeks

* Week 1 - Covers the high-level topics of reproducibility, and covers some of the key players / tools / ideas in this field. It also lists resources that are useful for learning more about this stuff.
* Week 2 - Describes the early stages of any analysis workflow. It covers best-practices in organizing data in folders, naming conventions, and early exploratory analyses.
* Week 3 - Focuses on data visualization and analysis, with a focus on statistics.

## Installation

The code in these materials requires a python distribution along with many
scientific libraries. See the "Installation" notebook in the week 2 folder
with instructions on how to install python and the jupyter notebook on
various operating systems
